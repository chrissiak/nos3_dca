This directory and its contents consist of a portion of the files from the untarred, ungzipped unix_dev.tgz, which is the NGA MPS GEOTRANS 3.5 (Geographic Translator) from the Mensuration Services Program of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

The only files that were kept were those files that are necessary for building and running the library, including data files, and the files that document the functionality (kept data files, PDFs, HTML/PNG/JS, source files (.h/.cpp).  None of the files retained had their contents altered; however, the directory structure was reorganized to be more convenient for building and use as a library.

From the Mensuration Services Program (MSP) User's Guide for MSP Geographic Translator (GEOTRANS) Version 3.5:

    GEOTRANS (Geographic Translator) is an application that allows you to convert geographic coordinates among a wide variety of coordinate systems, map projections, grids, and datums. GEOTRANS runs in the Microsoft Windows, LINUX, and UNIX environments.
